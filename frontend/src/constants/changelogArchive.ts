/**
 * This array is used to render the changelog. For each new version release,
 * you should simply update the archive and the changelog page will also be updated.
 *
 * The versions are ordered by their release dates descending, meaning
 * that the newest version should be the first element.
 *
 * If a version is missing new features, fixes, or deprecations, you
 * should simply supply an empty array for the respective category.
 *
 * The ``version`` should not be prepended by a "v", this will be done by the component itself.
